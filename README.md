# sketchy

## Project Description

The goal here is to build a simple draw program or doodle application 
that uses the wxPython Phoenix GUI toolkit. It is loosely based on the 
Doodle and Super Doodle samples that are distributed with wxPython. The 
application is written from Noel Rappin and Robin Dunn's book "wxPython 
in Action" (Chapter 6) and should work with Python 3.4+. Let's call 
it `sketchy`.

## Features

We intend to include the following features in this draw program:

* Show how to draw on a canvas.
* Track the mouse pointer when the left mouse button is down, and draw 
the sketch lines on the screen.
* Show how to deal with mouse events.
* Show how to update UI events.
* Add a status bar.
* Add a toolbar.
* Add a menubar.
* Use common dialogs, such as a file chooser and a color picker.
* Use sizers to lay out complicated widget sets.
* Add an about box.
* Add a splash screen.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have installed:

* Python: v3.4+
* wxPython: v4.0.0a3+
